We are NorthernWatch, 

a small but independent, security oriented, MSP. We study netowrk engineering, IDS, Firewalling, C2, OSINT, and malware detection. 

We believe in a free, fair but secure internet free, for anyone and everyone who wishes to lead a peaceful existence
and are willing to collaborate with anyone who truly feels the same. Our focus is geared towards providing local network, firewall, DNS, and other basic security configuration services for the rapidly increasing necessity by users to adapt as the cyber domain becomes more encompassing and prominent.
